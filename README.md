# DumbForces

**DumbForces** is a playful automation project that runs as a cron job to check if a user has solved a certain number of problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).  

If the user **fails** to meet the target, the script:  
1. Posts a *"disrespect"* message as an Instagram story.  
2. Sends money to a friend (because consequences hurt more when they're financial).
